        Pasta Aglio e Olio, originating from Naples, is the epitome of Italian
        simplicity. This dish, translating to "garlic and oil," relies on a
        handful of ingredients to create a satisfying and aromatic pasta
        experience. The combination of garlic, red pepper flakes, and
        good-quality olive oil showcases the essence of Italian cooking—allowing
        the flavors of few ingredients to shine.

      <h3 class="ingredient-title">What You'll Need</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti or linguini</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, adjust to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
        <li>Grated parmasan cheese, for serving</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="steps-title">How To Make It</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Cook the spaghetti or linguine in a
          large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of
          pasta water, then drain the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infuse the Oil:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the olive
          oil over low heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Let
          the garlic gently infuse the oil until it becomes golden and fragrant,
          about 5-7 minutes. Be cautious not to let the garlic brown too much,
          as it can become bitter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Season and Toss:</strong>Season the garlic oil with salt and
          black pepper. Add the cooked pasta directly into the skillet, tossing
          it well to coat each strand with the flavorful oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjust Consistency: </strong>If the pasta seems dry, add some
          of the reserved pasta water to create a silky sauce that clings to the
          pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve:</strong>Divide the pasta among plates. Garnish with
          fresh parsley and a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.
          Delight in the simplicity and aromatic richness of this classic Pasta
          Aglio e Olio!
        </li>
