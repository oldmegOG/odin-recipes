      <h3 class="steps-title">How To Make It</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong>Cook the spaghetti or linguine in a
          large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2
          cup of pasta water..
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the olive
          oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes.
          Sauté until the garlic is golden but not browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Tomatoes and Briny Ingredients:</strong>Pour in the
          crushed tomatoes, olives, and capers. Season with salt and black
          pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to
          meld together. If the sauce thickens too much, add a bit of the
          reserved pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>
